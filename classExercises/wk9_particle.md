* Particle Build is an **Integrated Development Environment**, or IDE. (IDE's allow software development in an application.
* The **Navigation bar** is on the left. On the top, there are three buttons, which serve important functions:
    * **Flash**: Flashes the current code to the device. This initiates an over-the-air firmware update and loads the new software onto your device.
    * **Verify**: This compiles your code without actually flashing it to the device; if there are any errors in your code, they will be shown in the debug console on the bottom of the screen.
    * **Save**: Saves any changes you've made to your code.
* At the bottom, there are four more buttons to navigate through the IDE:
    * **Code**: Shows a list of your firmware applications and lets you select which one to edit/flash.
    * **Library**: Explore libraries submitted by other users, and develop your own.
    * **Docs**: Brings you to the documentation for Particle.
    * **Devices**: Shows a list of your devices, so you can choose which to flash, and get more information on each device.
    * **Settings**: Change your password, log out, or get your access token for API calls.
* Keyboard shortcuts: https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Shortcuts
